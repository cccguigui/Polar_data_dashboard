Used to support Northern Prince Charles Mountains and Amery Ice Shelf operations.         The Prince Charles Mountains (PCMs) includes all the mountain areas around by the Lambert Glacier and the Amery ice Shelf  in Mac. Robertson Land. There are numerous mountain ranges and nunataks varying between 1000 m and 3000 m in height. Beaver Lake Base is on the western side of Beaver Lake by the northern shore of Pagadroma George and was established in 1995. The continental ice sheet is highest in the west and east and falls into the trough of the Lambert. The topography within the northern region is variable. The Aramis and Porthos Ranges consist of sharp peaks  with sheer rock faces and large wind scours. In the area of the Beaver Lake and Mawson Escarpment there are mainly rounded mountains with rubble surfaces.        ,,Accommodates 10 persons in total (4 Apple huts). Camping gear.

Australia,Casey,Casey Station,Station,Open,Year-Round,Casey,-66.282343,110.526792,88,,Casey is on the west coast of Law Dome  an almost circular ice cap 200 km in diameter rising to a height of 1395 m  110 km inland. The regularly traversed routes on Law Dome are mostly crevasse-free  the exceptions being the steep regions of the coast eat of Cape Folger  the Peterson Glacier  the inflow into the Vanderford Glacier  and the eastern coast of Sparkes Bay at the end of the Loken Moraine. In summer  melt streams and soft snow in the low areas between Loken Moraine and the coast often form hazards for vehicles. Beyond the moraine the surface is comparatively smooth and featureless  with patchy blue ice and snow for several kilometres  gradually changing to neve upon which small to medium sastrugi are encountered. At the southern (inland) edge of the Law Dome ice cape  the elevation drops to 600 m in a wide valley extending from the Totten Glacier to the Vanderford Glacier. South of this valley the plateau continues to rise gradually  reaching an altitude of some 3650 m as the Russian station Vostok is approached. It is a featureless plateau and navigational competence is essential. Although the average wind speed at Casey is 30 km/h  the weather can be deceptively calm. When the wind direction turns to the east  blizzards can set in with very little warning and rapidly reach wind speeds in excess of 150 km/h. These winds can last for several days. occur at any time of the year and can make travel hazardous. Keep a constant watch to the east  when the horizon becomes fuzzy you have less than 30 minutes to take shelter before a blow arrives. The direction of strong winds over the Law Dome area is usually easterly providing a constant sastrugi direction which is often an aid to navigation in bad weather. The inland plateau is characterised by frequent  persistent strong wind and drift  especially during winter months. Temperatures recorded in the station area range from +9.2°C (January) to -41°C (July).

Australia,Davis,Davis Station,Station,Open,Year-Round,Davis,-68.575938,77.969516,91,,Davis is on the edge of the Vestfold Hills  a triangular ice-free area approximately 400 km2 located on the coast of Princess Elizabeth Land. The hills are of low relief (maximum height 158 m) and are broken by valleys and penetrated deeply by fjords and lakes. They are bounded on two sides by the ice plateau and the Sorsdal Glacier. Numerous islands fringe the coast around Davis  up to 5 km offshore. Davis mean temperatures range from +2.9°C in January to -20.4°C in August  with recorded extremes of +13°C and -40°C. Long periods of relatively calm  fine conditions occur throughout the year. Winds are generally light  the yearly average is around 20 km/h. Violent winds and blizzards can commence with little warning  and gusts over 200 km/h have been recorded. At Platcha hut and other areas near the continental ice sheet  gale force (katabatic) winds regularly occur  even in otherwise fine weather. The effect diminishes significantly as distances of 5 km or more inland on the ice sheet are reached. Snow fall averages 78 mm/year  with the greater proportion of annual accumulation resulting from wind blown drift. Apart from several permanent ice banks  the hills are virtually snow free in summer and lightly covered in winter.    ,1957,Fuel is special antarctic blend fuel  aviation turbine fuel  synthetic low temperature engine and hydraulic oils  gear oils  glycol.,Doctor and surgery available.,---,---,

The plateau surface in the coastal region is mostly blue ice occasionally covered by light snow in winter and spring. The snow is deepest in valleys or on steep leeward slopes  while the higher ridges are invariably swept clear. Heavy melting occurs during summer and melt-water collects in well-defined streams and lakes. Although not necessarily deep they are a hazard to travellers  especially those in fast-moving transport. Further inland from the coast the surface is mainly snow or white ice with occasional blue ice patches. The mean annual windspeed at Mawson is almost 40 km/h although gusts measure well above 180 km/h. Sixteen kilometres inland the wind is much stronger. The winds usually increase after sunset and fall off around midday. Winds are predominantly south-easterly moving towards the west with the onset of bad weather. Mawson experiences long periods of fine weather broken at intervals by periods of high wind and heavy drifting snow. Temperatures range from 10°C to -36°C.,1954,Accommodates 47 persons plus two hospital beds.

The station is operated by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR).     It is located on a small peninsula at Gerlache Inlet  Terra Nova Bay  Ross Sea. The station can be reached either by ship or airplane. The sea ice conditions are generally favourable for aircraft operation (including Hercules C-130) early in the season. Later in the season landings are only possible on Browning Pass west of Gondwana. In this case helicopter shuttle flights have to provide the linkage to the Gondwana Station.    The Terra Nova Bay area is one of the few ideal locations for Antarctic stations in this part of the Ross Sea. Gravel terraces on a slightly sloped terrain provide sufficient space for station buildings and helicopter landing pads. The area is free of snow early in the season and relatively sheltered against catabatic winds which are generally channelled by the Priestley Glacier and deviated towards Hells Gate. The absence of Penguin colonies in the Terra Nova Bay area is another advantage of this location.     The first station building was erected in 1983 during the GANOVEX III (German Antarctic North Victoria Land Expedition) as a bivouac hut. During GANOVEX V (1988/89) Gondwana was enlarged and upgraded from a bivouac hut to a summer station. During GANOVEX IX (2005/06) the station was restored. A new painting of the walls and a new waterproof roof membrane protect the station.,1983,The main building consists of two rows of eight 20ft-containers which are connected by a corridor to which all rooms open  i.e. workshop  food store  kitchen  mess and sanitary rooms  the radio room  a lounge and further rooms for scientific programs.

The station will also provide ground service for scientific aircraft mission above the inland ice plateau.     The station is located on the inland ice plateau (Amundsenisen  Wegnerisen). The distance along the sledge traverse route to Neumayer Station III is about 750 km.    Access to the station is possible by means of sledge traverses starting from NEUMAYER STATION III at the cost or by aircraft support in the frame of Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN). The air link is mainly used for the transport of personnel  light weighted scientific cargo and food. The advantage of this aircraft access is that it became possible to start scientific works early in the season or to carry out a short stay for maintenance and service automatic stations.     Supply of the station is mainly based on sledge traverses to transport large amount of fuel  consumables and material. To travel from NEUMAYER STATION III to KOHNEN STATION takes 11 days on average. The typical arrangement of a sledge train is 6 towing vehicles (Pistenbulli)  12 sledges carrying piece goods and containers  and 5 sledges with tank containers and accommodation facilities. On average about 180 tons of supply goods are needed to run the station. The fuel consumption is about 400 litres per one ton of payload over a distance of 1 000 km.
